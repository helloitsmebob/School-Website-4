               Starting on Monday 4/5, SkyView Academy will begin celebrating our 3rd Wish Week.  We are excited to honor this year’s Wish Kid, Kian from Greenwood Village.  Throughout this week-long event, we partner with Make-A-Wish Colorado and their “Kids For Wish Kids” program to feature a child with critical illnesses. We are so excited to see our community come together as we work to raise $5,000 and grant wishes for kids like Kian.  Kian is currently waiting for his wish to be granted! This is a special opportunity for us to demonstrate honorable leadership through service. Though this Wish Week will look different than in past years, there are several opportunities for K-12 students and families to get involved and make this week special.  Many of these will be virtual this year with our own digital fundraising page to contribute to this great cause!

                         <br>

                         School virtual events are offered monthly. Please check the “Visit SkyView” link for more information.

                         <br>

                        2. We are an out of district family, does that make a difference in our enrollment priority?
                         <br>

                        No. SkyView does not give preferences for in or out of district families.
                         <br>
 <br>
                        3. How many students are in each grade? 
                        <br>

                        Kindergarten: 20:1 student/teacher ratio with 100 students overall 
                         <br>

                        1st – 5th grade: 26:1; with 104 students per grade level
                         <br>

                        6th – 8th grade: ratio varies depending on class; 118 students per grade level
                         <br>

                        9th – 12th grade: approximately 15:1 student/teacher ratio; 125 students maximum per grade level
                         <br>
 <br>
                        4. Does SkyView offer a half-day Kindergarten program?
                         <br>

                        SkyView Academy only offers a full-day kindergarten program as we feel this best prepares our young learners for the rigor of our K-12 program. This is a non-tuition-based program as funding was approved in the spring of 2019 from the State.

                         <br>

                        We follow DCSD guidelines which state that “eligible children must be 5 by October 1st” of the year in which they will be enrolled for Kindergarten. For 2021-22, students must be five by 10/1/2021. If you feel your child would benefit from entering Kindergarten a year early, please apply for Early Access Admission through DCSD’s Gifted Education department.
                         <br>

 <br>
                        SkyView does not offer bus transportation. Parents are encouraged to carpool with other families. Way To Go is a free service that matches families living near one another so individuals may make contact prior to the beginning of the school year to set up a carpool schedule. Families are automatically opted in to Way To Go unless they contact us to be removed from the list. Please note that being opted in does not require a family to participate in a carpool, it just makes the information available to you.

Mission
SkyView Academy offers a research-based, content-rich liberal arts program with a commitment to foreign language studies and community service. Staff, parents, and students are actively involved in a culture of expectation and support where individuals are respected, valued, and known by the content of their character.
 <br>

                         <br>
                         <br>
                        
Founding Principles
The vision for SkyView Academy began in 2004 when a group of Highlands Ranch parents came together to create a more challenging and meaningful educational program for their children and the community at large. Our founding team spent two years turning this dream into reality, opening their first school in Parker in 2006. SkyView Academy followed four years later, serving preschool – 5th grade initially and growing annually grade-by-grade with our first graduating class of seniors honored in 2015.
 <br>
Our founding team was comprised of many qualified and dedicated parents, teachers, and community members with diverse backgrounds who shared a common educational vision for the school. Today, SkyView Academy continues to offer a program deeply rooted in the foundation created by our founding team as outlined by the following principles:
 <br>
To foster a joy of learning and a passion for knowledge in each student by offering a rigorous, research-based and content-rich curriculum that challenges each student to achieve at their highest potential.
To teach children to be more aware and respectful of other cultures, languages and traditions through an integrated world language program that begins in preschool.
To encourage children to actively participate in their local community and to help them gain an appreciation and increased sense of compassion for others regardless of ability or circumstance.
To create independent, well-rounded and confident students through a program that effectively balances academics, physical education and general wellness.
To provide a school culture where students, parents and educators are welcomed, valued and actively engaged in the learning process.
                         <br>
To hire staff members that are committed to the mission of our school and provide opportunities for them to learn from each other and to learn from other educational professionals.
To provide a student learning environment that increases academic achievement and fosters the development of social skills through effective classroom management strategies and a clear and consistent school-wide discipline policy.
To recognize that not all students start at the same level, learn in the same way or master skills at the same pace and to provide a variety of teaching strategies and instructional methods that recognize these differences to make learning accessible to every student.
                         <br>
To increase awareness and support for parental choice in education by creating a community of advocates that are actively involved in the charter school industry.

5 Pillars of the best schools
As with any sound structure, a solid foundation must be poured and pillars constructed to hold up to the test of time. The same is true for the students of SkyView Academy. Our foundation rests in the principles defined by our founding team and our 5 pillars represent what we teach our students so they can stand the test of time and enter the world as honorable leaders and life-long learners.
 <br>
You will hear the phrase “AS ONE” around SkyView. This means our entire PK-12 program provides building blocks for our youngest students in preschool through our graduating seniors. Students will find consistency, support, and rigor along their academic journey which progresses in our five differentiators, our pillars: Core Knowledge, Classical College Prep, Character Education, Service Learning, and World Languages.
 <br>
                         <br>
                         <br>
                         <br>
Core Knowledge (grades PK-8)
The basis of Core Knowledge is simple and powerful: knowledge builds on knowledge. The more you know, the more you are able to learn. This seemingly logical insight, well-established by cognitive science, has profound implications for both teaching and learning. Nearly all of our most important goals for education – greater reading comprehension, the ability to think critically and solve problems, even higher test scores – are a function of the depth and breadth of our knowledge.
 <br>
By outlining the precise content that every child should learn in language arts and literature, history and geography, mathematics, science, music, and the visual arts, the Core Knowledge curriculum represents a first-of-its kind effort to identify the foundational knowledge every child needs to reach these goals, and to teach it, grade-by-grade, year-by-year, in a coherent, age-appropriate sequence. Learn more about Core Knowledge.
 <br>
Classical College Prep (grades 9-12)
SkyView’s high school program aligns classical content and pedagogy with current college preparation standards emphasizing critical thinking and analysis, depth of knowledge, and the development of value-centered human beings. Our high school values the important balance between providing engaging content-expert teachers and empowering students to drive their learning.
 <br>
At the same time, we are committed to preparing students for the very best colleges in the country. It follows that the rigorous classical course content taught in class will address state, college board, and SAT standards as necessary. Technology is used as a tool, needed to prepare students for the modern world and collegiate experience. This integrated approach helps ensure students are exposed to the standards and skills that drive assessment and college entrance.
 <br>
                         <br>
                         <br>
                         <br>
Character
Character Education is a hallmark of SkyView Academy and one of our primary differentiators. As such, we have implemented the Capturing Kids’ Hearts program reinforced within the content of our curriculum to develop healthy relationships between members of our school’s educational community. The program uses a universal language to teach children to self-manage and handle conflict when it occurs with the belief that “if you reach a child’s heart you will reach their mind.”
 <br>
Through our character education program, our students learn learn to do and be their best through responsible and intelligent choices. The five character traits we model and teach are: respect, integrity, excellence, responsibility, and citizenship. When children learn to make good choices they are more committed to learning and they develop habits that make them life-long readers and writers, build student’s self-esteem, help them learn to resolve conflicts, appreciate and respect diversity, manage aggressive behaviors, and promote integrity allowing students to become successful and develop into strong, competent, caring, and responsible citizens.
 <br>
                         <br>
                         <br>
                         <br>
Service
Service learning is another differentiator touching our students at every level, PK-12th grade. Hands-on opportunities for students to contribute to SkyView, our local community, and/or global communities result in long-lasting partnerships while teaching the importance of giving back. Service projects are teacher-led in PK-8, coordinated across grade levels and scheduled thoughtfully to ensure manageability, while students in grades 9-12 are required to complete 40 hours of service per school year to graduate.
 <br>
Our SkyView community has supported many organizations over the years including Lighthouse Assisted Living, Extreme Community Makeover, The Action Center, Warm Coats Warm Hearts, Junior Achievement and Volunteers for Outdoor Colorado.

                         <br>
                         <br>
World Languages
As our society grows more global in nature, foreign language studies becomes an important foundational element in a child’s educational program. SkyView offers PK-8 students daily Spanish language instruction, while high school students have the option of taking American Sign Language, French, Latin or Spanish.  Our goal is for students to acquire proficiency in interpersonal communication, interpretive communication, and presentational communication through the four integrative skills of listening, speaking, reading and writing.
